# Web Application Security Assessment 

## 📌 Overview
This project documents a basic web application security assessment conducted as part of a cybersecurity learning task.  
The assessment focuses on identifying common web vulnerabilities using automated and manual techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand a web application's authentication and user flows
- Identify basic security vulnerabilities
- Practice using OWASP ZAP and browser-based testing
- Document findings in a professional penetration testing report

## 🌐 Target Application
- Test Application: http://testphp.vulnweb.com
- Type: Intentionally vulnerable web application (for educational purposes only)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- OWASP ZAP (Active & Passive Scan)
- Browser Developer Tools
- Manual payload testing

## 🔍 Testing Performed
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) testing
- SQL Injection testing
- Security misconfiguration checks
- HTTP security header analysis

## 📊 Key Findings
- High-risk vulnerabilities: XSS, SQL Injection
- Medium-risk vulnerabilities: Missing CSRF protection, missing security headers
- Low-risk issues: Information disclosure
- Informational findings related to best practices

## 📄 Report
The full penetration testing report is available in the `report/` directory.
